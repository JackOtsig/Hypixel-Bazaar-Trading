# Hypixel-Bazaar-Trading
An attempt at a HypixeI SkybIock trading bot. Co-written by @OwenBrosseau

currently doesnt work. problem being the bot isnt able to recognize when an order has filled. the main idea I have to fix it is loggin the number of orders before one is placed, adding the amount of the order, then keep track of how many are added after, then by keeping track of how many have sold you can tell where your orders are in the stack. probably sounds like aids but it will be done just watch
